# diminutives
This project will be about the difference of the use of diminutives between females and males in Dutch on Twitter. The independent variable is gender and the dependent variable is the use of diminutives in the Dutch language on Twitter.

The research question is: Do females or males use more diminutives on Twitter in Dutch?

I think that females use more diminutives.
